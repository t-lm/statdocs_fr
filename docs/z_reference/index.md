# Getting started

Hi, welcome on the user guide.

If you want to understand what Statit is and why we created it, head to [**the first section**](what_is.md).

If you want to jump straight into using Statit through various channels, head to:

* [Using Statit with the web application](gs/web.md)
* [Using Statit directly in Microsoft Excel](gs/excel.md)

Finally, you will find the full **REST API reference** [**here**](reference/api_rest.md).

Please get back to us with any feedback at [hi@gostatit.com](mailto:hi@gostatit.com)
