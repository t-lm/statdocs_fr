# Get started on the Web

Statit can be used fully in the browser.

This section explains **how to start using Statit with a web browser**. <!--For the documentation regarding creating workspace and publishing metrics, please head over to the [**web reference**](/reference/web.md).--> Before continuing, **please sign-in to your account or create one [here](https://gostatit.com/sign)**.


## **Workspaces**

**Teams and organisations create workspaces to manage and share their metrics.**  In the following example, we will access the "[**xrate**](https://www.gostatit.com/xrare)" **workspace**. This workspace covers **exchange rates** metrics.

Whilst most workspaces are private, with an access limited inside teams and organisations, a certain number of workspaces are "public". These "public" workspaces are maintained by Statit or partners and distribute public statistics.


## **Collections**

Inside workspaces, metrics are organised in collections.

Collections are defined by subject or source of data. Below, we will start working with the "**xrate/weekly**" collection that includes all **weekly exchange rate metrics**.

Here is the link to the collection of [weekly exchange rate metrics](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/weekly) that includes the metric we have looked at before. Click on the "About" tab for a description of the collection.

You can then browse the metrics in the collection. Metrics are presented like files in a folder. Navigate to the bottom of the folder to view any metric.
