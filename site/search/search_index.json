Metrics are difficult to manage and access Whether it is monitoring environmental indicators, planning investment or researching economic trends, metrics are critical bits of information to understand a situation and take actions . The problem is there is no simple way to manage metrics today . Metrics are often stored in various places (applications, dashboards, reports, analyst team) and complex to understand . Like books in medieval times, metrics are only accessible to the most advanced analytical users - preventing most collaborators to take part independently analysis. A library of metrics Statit turns things around and provides an online space where teams manage and access metrics. It has three main characteristics: Accessible to all - It is simple to navigate across metrics and access them - by anyone in the team, there is no barrier to metrics knowledge Accessible in the tools you use today - Whether it is a web browser, Microsoft Excel or a programming language (curl/ nodejs/ python), metrics can be accessed and edited - No need to adopt a new tool Very simple to get started - Start publishing and sharing metrics in minutes Organised for teams Teams build workspaces to share their metrics . Inside workspaces, metrics are organised inside collections. Each collection can be public - accessible by all members of the workspace - or private - only accessible by invited users. Inside collections, members have specific roles. Some manage the collection and can invite users. Others can edit the metrics. Finally, others can only access the series. Private or public spaces Some workspaces are \"public\" and can be joined by everyone on the Internet after sign-up. Open workspaces are useful to share open or collaborative datasets as metrics.

Make sure you have read getting started with Statit on the web to understand the basics of how Statit works. This section explains how to start using Statit with the REST API . For the complete documentation covering the REST API, please head over to the REST API reference . Set-up and basic concepts API format The API accepts HTTP GET and POST requests . All examples are presented with 'curl'. You can of course complete requests in any language. End-point All requests must be addressed to: https://api.gostatit.com/core . Core stands for the core API. ### request curl https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"message\": \"Welcome on Statit core API\" } Authentication Your requests must be identified with your credentials : your username and API Key. Your username and API key can be found in the account section in the home page for your profile. The API uses basic Http authentication . On the command line, it looks like ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"code\": \"ERROR_PARAM_REQUIRED\", ... } Actions Once you are authentified, you can call specific actions: getSerie, getCollection, putSerie ... You will do this by adding a json object to the query specifying the action called and the required inputs for the action. ### request curl -X POST \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"getSerie\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"xrate/weekly/eur/chf\"}}' \\ -u username:apikey \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"Item\": { \"unit\": \"Swiss Franc\", ... } } In the request above, we call the 'getSerie' action to get a single metric and pass a parameter called input with the 'id' of the metric we are requiring. If you would like to learn the basics about metric identifiers, please head over to Getting started on the web . Errors If your request can not be processed, the API will return an error code with an error message. ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"getSerie\" }' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"code\": \"ERROR_PARAM_REQUIRED\", \"message\": \"Error.

It contains both metric metadata and data. Note that observations is a stringified array. You can transform it into an array using JSON parsers. Listing metrics The API let you request \"children\" metrics with a single parent. As an example, if you are looking to get all weekly euro exchange rates, you will call xrate/weekly/eur and the request will return all related metrics. It is necessary to specify exactly the id of the parent. The size of the response is limited to 1MB. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"listSeries\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"xrate/weekly/eur\"}}' \\ -u username:apikey \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response ### response { \"Items\": [{ \"unit\": \"Swiss Franc\", \"frequency\": \"W\", \"sources\": \"ECB (European Central Bank)\", \"name\": \"Swiss Franc for 1 EUR\", \"updated\": \"2021-07-19T14:55:54.320Z\", \"notes\": \"\", \"observations\": [ [ \"2009-01-12\", 1.5004600000000001 ], [ \"2009-01-19\", 1.48424 ], [ \"2009-01-26\", 1.4874800000000001 ], [ \"2009-02-02\", 1.5029 ] ... ] } ... ] } Next steps You have now learnt about the basics of the REST API to access metrics.

Workspaces Teams and organisations create workspaces to manage and share their metrics. In the following example, we will access the \" xrate \" workspace . This workspace covers exchange rates metrics. Whilst most workspaces are private, with an access limited inside teams and organisations, a certain number of workspaces are \"public\". These \"public\" workspaces are maintained by Statit or partners and distribute public statistics. Collections Inside workspaces, metrics are organised in collections. Collections are defined by subject or source of data. Below, we will start working with the \" xrate/weekly \" collection that includes all weekly exchange rate metrics . Here is the link to the collection of weekly exchange rate metrics that includes the metric we have looked at before. Click on the \"About\" tab for a description of the collection. You can then browse the metrics in the collection. Metrics are presented like files in a folder. Navigate to the bottom of the folder to view any metric. Metrics A metric is a number of measurements over time . Every metric on Statit is defined with its own \"name\" or identifier . Metrics identifiers are similar to file identifiers on a computer such as xrate/weekly/eur/chf . Let's have a look at the weekly Euro-Swiss Franc exchange rates . Click on the link to reach the page of the metric. The metric is described by its name, unit, sources, start date, end date, a description and finally its observations presented as a line chart. Research You might want to zoom in on a specific time period or average observation values over time. You can do this from the metrics page. To select a specific time period, use the sliders below the chart. You can can place your mouse over the line to see the value of the observation. If you would like to see all values, press the grid on the top left hand side of the chart. If you want to aggregate or transform observations (for instance, look at a moving average), press the wheel on the top right hand side of the chart.
