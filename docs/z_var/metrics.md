# Get started on the Web

Statit can be used fully in the browser.

This section explains **how to start using Statit with a web browser**. <!--For the documentation regarding creating workspace and publishing metrics, please head over to the [**web reference**](/reference/web.md).--> Before continuing, **please sign-in to your account or create one [here](https://gostatit.com/sign)**.


## **Metrics**

A **metric is a number of measurements over time**.

**Every metric on Statit is defined with its own "name" or identifier**. Metrics identifiers are similar to file identifiers on a computer such as [xrate/weekly/eur/chf](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/weekly/eur/chf).

Let's have a look at [the weekly Euro-Swiss Franc exchange rates](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/weekly/eur/chf). Click on the link to reach the page of the metric.

The metric is described by its name, unit, sources, start date, end date, a description and finally its observations presented as a line chart.
